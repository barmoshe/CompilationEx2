Recursive Descent Parser for Parsing Movies

This is a simple implementation of a recursive descent parser in C, which parses input files containing movie data and determines whether more DC or Marvel superheroes have appeared in movies, based on the input data.

The parser was created using a simplified version of the Bison code for the same task, and consists of the following components:

movies.y: The main file containing the parser code, which is generated using a parser generator tool such as Bison.
movies.lex: A file containing the lexical analyzer code, which breaks the input file down into individual tokens that can be processed by the parser.
lex.yy.c: The C code generated by Flex, based on the movies.lex file.
movies.txt: An example input file that the parser can be run against to demonstrate its functionality.
makefile: A script that compiles the parser and creates an executable file.
To run the parser, simply navigate to the directory containing the files and run make. This will compile the parser and create an executable file called movies. To run the parser on an input file, use the command ./movies <input-file-name>.

The output of the parser will be a message indicating which publisher has had more superheroes appear in movies.
